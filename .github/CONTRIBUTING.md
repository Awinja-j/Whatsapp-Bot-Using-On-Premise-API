Check to see what [types of contributions](https://github.com/Awinja-j/Whatsapp-Bot-Using-On-Premise-API/blob/main/.github/TYPES_OF_CONTRIBUTIONS.md) we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code âœ¨.

### Issues

Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

## Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Awinja-j/Whatsapp-Bot-Using-On-Premise-API/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See [Labels]() for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
